# React Native: Missing Native Module Error

This repository demonstrates a common yet elusive error in React Native development: the missing native module error. This error typically occurs when a dependency (library) that requires native code isn't properly linked or installed.

## The Problem

Imagine you're using a library like `react-native-camera`.
If you don't correctly link the native modules (Android and iOS), your application will likely crash or throw an error stating that the module cannot be found.

## How to Reproduce

The example demonstrates a simulated scenario where a native module is missing.  Follow these steps to reproduce the error (comment out the solution for this):

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn`.
3. Run the app on an Android or iOS emulator/device (you might need to run appropriate native build steps depending on the environment and the native module requirements, if a native module existed in this case). 
4. Observe the error.

## Solution

The solution in `missingNativeModuleSolution.js` provides one example of properly installing and linking. Most library documentation should detail the proper steps for linking native modules. However, the process often varies depending on the library itself and your React Native version.  In short, this usually involves:

1. **Correct installation**: This usually involves using a package manager like npm or yarn.
2. **Linking**: This typically requires running platform-specific commands to link the native code to the JS environment (using something like react-native link). 
3. **Building**: Depending on the library, you might need to rebuild your native code after installing and linking.
4. **Troubleshooting**: Check your package.json and native build configurations for potential issues.
